## Mapping the R Community

This project was inspired by [Steph de Silva](https://twitter.com/StephdeSilva)'s UseR! 2018 Keynote.

**Beyond Syntax: the power and potentiality of open source communities**

With this keynote as context, I want to collect some or all the following datasets:

* R community **twitter accounts** and **tweeting activity**
* R community **github accounts** and **projects**, and **collaboration** activity
* R community **email lists**
* R community **meetup membership/attendance**
* R **conference attendance** (likely using Twitter hashtags)
* R **organisation affiliation** (rOpenSci, RStudio, R-core, etc)

And with these datasets I hope to use social network analysis to understand and describe the shape of the R community, and observe:

* changes in the **shape of the community** over time
* different approaches for **newcomers** looking to engage with the community
* topics that the community is **excited** about
* where the community is seeing the most **growth**

I will be blogging regularly about this project (blogs are part of the assessment criteria for UTS!) using the tag [**R Community**](http://perrystephenson.me/tags/r-community-project/).
